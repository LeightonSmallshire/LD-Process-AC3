# Description

The first executable, ac3_demodulate, takes a stream of unsigned 8-bit samples at 46.08MHz to produce a stream of QPSK
symbols, ready for the next executable. The second executable, ac3_demodulate, decodes the stream of symbols into
playable ac3 audio frames, while producing
Reed-solomon, CRC and other statistics in the log file.

# Example Usage

#### Syntax

```
ac3_demodulate [options] source_file output_file [log_file]
ac3_decode [options] source_file output_file [log_file]
```

#### example_usage.sh

```
ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -i "$path" -f s16le -c:a pcm_s16le TP0
sox -r 40000000 -b 16 -c 1 -e signed -t raw TP0 -b 8 -r 46080000 -e unsigned -c 1 -t raw TP1 sinc -n 500 2600000-3160000
cmake-build-debug/demodulate/ac3_demodulate TP1 TP2 demodulate_log
cmake-build-debug/decode/ac3_decode TP2 "$outpath" decode_log
```

In the example usage, ffmpeg and sox are used to format, resample and filter the source signal before processing with
ac3_demodulate and ac3_decode. The TP0, TP1 and TP3 files are intermediate files, used for caching and are not used
when piping directly between the commands.
